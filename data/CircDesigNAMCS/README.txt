This R-file computes a linear regression on the mfeNoDiag function, to get an empirical baseline for the expected self similarity of a 50% G/C random DNA strand. 

Two linear regressions are performed, one with DNA data and one with RNA data.

If the behavior of a folding function changes, then run circdesigna.energy.SelfSimilarityBaseline and collect the data, and rerun the R script.
